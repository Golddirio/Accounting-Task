# Accounting-Task
Some companies use a prepayment schedule to track the amortization of prepaid items. At each month-end, the accountant records the necessary accounting entries to recognize the expenses for that month.

 

The Python script automates the generation of all required accounting entries for a given month. Below is a sample of the accounting entries for "Webhosting" for the month of "May 2024":

 

Date | Description | Reference | Account | Amount

31/5/2024 | Prepayment amortisation for Webhosting | 46248 | EXP001 | 833.33

31/5/2024 | Prepayment amortisation for Webhosting | 46248 | PRE001 | -833.33
